#! /usr/bin/env perl
# By Nathan Sheffield, University of Virginia, 2018

# This is an incredibly fast Perl utility that re-pairs fastq files that have been 
# de-paired by running a single-end alignment on paired-end data. 
# It assumes that the the first fastq file (say, read1) contains a subset of reads
# found in the second fastq file (say, read2). 
# It also assumes that the files were in proper order to begin with.
# It will return a filtered version of the second file, which only has reads
# present in the first tile.

# Perl is the right language for this utility; because this is a high
# IO task (spitting out hundreds of millions of lines), and Perl is highly
# optimized for this type of IO process. A corresponding python
# program will take 10-100 fold longer to do the same thing.
