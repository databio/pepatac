# Example PEP

This folder contains a PEP, which is made of two files: the [sample table](test_annotation.csv) with one row per sample, and the [project config](test_config.yaml) with project settings. You can read detailed specifications in [how to create a PEP](https://pepkit.github.io/docs/home/).
